# hammerJam-2019 -- Poop Dreams
## Submission for Hammer Jam 2019.

Hammer Jam ran from 8am to 8pm on Saturday, April 27th, 2019. About 13 teams competed with 11 games ready for presentation. The theme was '[Own Your Throne](https://www.hamilton.ca/home-property-and-development/water-sewer/flushables-own-your-throne)' and games had to make use of provided characters from the marketing campaign.


## Gameplay
Pieces randomly disperse from each pipe. Player can drop a piece from each column to re-arrange the pipes. Good flushables should continue into the sewage pipe, while unflushables should go in the trash.


## Major Issues
1. The ability to move pieces around is disabled on game over. Fixing this is priority number one.
2. Pieces move so slowly that the game is unreasonably difficult.
3. You can release too many items at one time (this  might be worth keeping as an exploitable bug-turned-feature?)
